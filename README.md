# Booru Manager (Avalonia)

Minimal Booru Manager GUI scaffold using Avalonia.

Quick start (requires .NET 7 SDK):

```bash
cd src/BooruManager
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

This scaffold includes:
- Main window with search box and image grid
- ViewModel, model and a stub `BooruApiService` (uses `picsum.photos` placeholders)

Next steps:
- Implement real Booru API adapters
- Add lazy loading, caching and downloading
- Enhance animations and UI polish
